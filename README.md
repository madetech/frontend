## Status

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@madetech/frontend.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@madetech/frontend)

## What's included?

 - Bootstrap front-end framework
 - Compiled and minified assets, e.g. CSS, JS and images, found in `dist/`
 - A Sass library, found in `src/`
 - A React component library, found in `src/components/`

**Boostrap**

In order to provide a quick and easy way of creating sites we extend the Bootstrap front-end framework. We bundle it whether you are using compiled assets or consuming the library via NPM.

**Compiled and minified assets**

We provide the following assets for ease of use. If you're using GitHub Pages, the easiest way to get started is copying the compiled assets into your project. If you'd prefer a "cleaner" way, investigate using the component library instead.

The CSS and JavaScript includes Bootstrap so there is no need to pull that in separately, though you will need to include jQuery.

```

You can download [madetech-frontend.zip](https://github.com/madetech/frontend/releases) from our latest release.

**Sass library**

The Sass library extends Bootstrap's own Sass. You too can either choose to extend it or consume the compiled CSS.

**React component library**

We export React components for use in projects that use React. It's really easy to get started with Create React App or Gatsby for example.
